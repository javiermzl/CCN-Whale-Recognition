# Image-Recognition
Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. 

Project developed for [Bachelor Thesis](http://oa.upm.es/53050/1/TFG_JAVIER_MARTINEZ_LLAMAS.pdf).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- CUDA 
- cuDNN
- Dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground/data))

## Execution

Two libraries (TensorFlow and Keras) have been used for the development. Both programs have the same result and purpose.

#### Keras

```
python keras_app.py [-h] (-t | -e)
```

#### TensorFlow

```
python tensor_app.py [-h] (-t | -e)
```
